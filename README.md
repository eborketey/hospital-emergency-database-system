# Hospital Emergency Management Database System

## Project Overview
Comprehensive SQL database system designed for hospital emergency management, featuring 8+ interconnected tables for patient prioritization, staff allocation, and resource optimization. This system streamlines emergency care workflows while providing data-driven insights for operational excellence.

## Business Objectives
- **Patient Prioritization**: Automated triage system based on medical severity
- **Staff Allocation**: Optimize healthcare worker assignments across departments
- **Resource Management**: Track and allocate medical equipment and supplies
- **Performance Analytics**: Monitor hospital efficiency and patient outcomes
- **Operational Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for process improvement

## Key Features
- **8+ Interconnected Tables** with comprehensive relational design
- **Advanced SQL Queries** with complex joins and aggregations
- **Automated Triage System** for patient priority classification
- **Equipment Usage Tracking** with predictive maintenance insights
- **Staff Performance Metrics** and workload optimization
- **Real-time Resource Allocation** for emergency situations

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables
1. **Patients** - Patient demographics and medical history
2. **Staff** - Healthcare workers and their specializations
3. **Departments** - Hospital departments and capacity information
4. **Equipment** - Medical equipment inventory and status
5. **Emergency_Cases** - Active emergency cases and classifications
6. **Treatments** - Medical procedures and interventions
7. **Resource_Allocation** - Equipment and staff assignments
8. **Performance_Metrics** - Operational KPIs and outcomes

### Key Relationships
- **Patient-to-Case**: One-to-many relationship for emergency episodes
- **Staff-to-Department**: Many-to-many with specialization tracking
- **Equipment-to-Department**: Resource distribution and utilization
- **Case-to-Treatment**: Treatment history and medical interventions

## Business Intelligence Capabilities

### Patient Flow Analysis
- Average wait times by triage priority
- Department capacity utilization rates
